# What Tools Do I Need to Use node-gyp?

## Overview

To build native Node.js addons using **node-gyp**, you need to have specific software tools installed and properly configured on your system. These tools vary depending on your operating system but generally include Python, a C/C++ compiler toolchain, and platform-specific dependencies.

This page guides you through the essential prerequisites required to successfully use node-gyp, including minimum supported versions and pointers to the detailed setup instructions.

---

## 1. Python

### Why Python?

Node-gyp relies on **Python** to generate build files and control the build process, as it uses the GYP build system under the hood. 

### Supported Python Versions

- **Python 3.x** is required, with **Python 3.6 or later** strongly recommended.
- Python 2 is **not supported**.

### How node-gyp Finds Python

node-gyp automatically attempts to locate Python through the following mechanisms, in order:

- The `NODE_GYP_FORCE_PYTHON` environment variable or command-line `--python` flag
- The `python` path configured via npm (`npm config get python`)
- The `PYTHON` environment variable
- Standard system `python3` or `python` commands
- Windows-specific default Python install locations

If node-gyp cannot find a suitable Python executable, it will error out with guidance on how to specify the correct Python path.

### Configuring Python

Refer to the [Configuring the Python Dependency](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/docs/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/python-setup.md) page for detailed setup and tips.

## 2. C/C++ Compiler Toolchain

Because node-gyp builds native addons by compiling C/C++ source code, you need platform-appropriate compiler toolchains:

### On Windows

- **Visual Studio 2022** or later, with the **Desktop development with C++** workload installed.
- Alternatively, Visual Studio Build Tools for C++ with the necessary components installed.

Node-gyp needs the MSBuild system and C++ compilers. Notably, the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools must be present and properly configured in your environment.

Refer to the detailed [Windows: Visual Studio Setup](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/docs/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/windows-visual-studio-setup.md) guide for installation and configuration.

### On macOS

- Install **Xcode Command Line Tools** (CLT).
- This provides the `clang` compiler and related build tools.

Run the following command to install CLT if not installed:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

See [Prerequisites & System Requirements](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/docs/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/prerequisites-system-requirements.md#macos) for details.

### On Unix/Linux

- Install **make**, **gcc**, and **g++**.
- Ensure `python3` is installed (see Python section).

Use your distribution's package manager, e.g., `apt`, `yum`, or `dnf`, to install build-essential tools.

Example on Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential python3
```

More details are available on the [Prerequisites & System Requirements](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/docs/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/prerequisites-system-requirements.md#linux) page.

## 3. Platform-Specific Dependencies

### Windows

- Visual Studio with C++ workload
- Windows SDK (certain Windows versions require specific SDK versions)
- For ARM64 support, ensure the correct Visual Studio components for ARM are installed.

### macOS

- Xcode Command Line Tools
- For older macOS versions, ensure compatibility of the SDK and build toolchain.

### Linux / Unix

- Standard development tools (`make`, `gcc`, `g++`, `python3`)
- Linux kernel headers might be required depending on native modules.

---

## 4. Additional Tips & Best Practices

- Always verify your build environment after installation by running initial build commands and checking for errors.
- Keep your tools updated to supported versions to avoid compatibility issues.
- Check system PATH and environment variables to ensure compilers and Python executables are discoverable.

## 5. Quick Reference - Summary of Required Tools by OS

| Operating System | Required Tools                        | Minimum Version/Notes               |
|------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Windows          | Visual Studio 2022 (C++ workload)  | Latest stable VS 2022 recommended  |
|                  | Python 3.6+                        | Node-gyp requires Python 3 only    |
| macOS            | Xcode Command Line Tools (CLT)     | Installed via `xcode-select`       |
|                  | Python 3.6+                        | System or installed via package mgr |
| Linux/Unix       | gcc, g++, make, python3             | Use distro's build-essential pkg   |

## 6. Where to Get Help

If you run into issues with tool setup or compatibility, consult:

- [node-gyp Installation Guide](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)
- [Windows Visual Studio Setup](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/docs/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/windows-visual-studio-setup.md)
- [Python Setup](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/docs/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/python-setup.md)
- [Common Errors and How to Fix Them](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting-common-issues/common-errors-and-solutions.md)

<Tip>
Having the correct versions of Python and your compiler toolchain installed and discoverable on your system path is critical for node-gyp to function without errors.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Do not attempt to use Python 2 with node-gyp. This is unsupported and will cause build failures.
</Warning>

## 7. Next Steps

Once your tools are installed and configured, move on to:

- Creating your `binding.gyp` file to configure your addon build.
- Running `node-gyp configure` and `node-gyp build` to compile your native addon.
- Validating your setup and build outputs.

Consider reading the following guides:

- [Creating Your binding.gyp File](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/docs/getting-started/first-build-validation/creating-binding-gyp.md)
- [Configuring and Building Your Addon](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/docs/getting-started/first-build-validation/running-configure-build-commands.md)
- [Validating Your Setup](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/docs/getting-started/first-build-validation/validating-installation.md)
