# Windows: Visual Studio Setup

This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions to help you install, configure, and verify your Visual Studio and related Build Tools setup on Windows. These tools are essential to compile native Node.js addons using `node-gyp`, enabling seamless native module development on Windows platforms.

---

## 1. Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before setting up Visual Studio for use with `node-gyp`, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows 7 or higher (recommended Windows 10 or 11 for best compatibility).
- **Python**: A supported Python version installed (minimum Python 3.6, preferably latest stable 3.x). Compatible versions vary by node-gyp version.
- **Visual Studio Version**: Visual Studio 2017, 2019, or 2022 with the correct components installed.
- **Workloads & Components**: "Desktop development with C++" workload including C++ build tools, Windows SDKs, and MSBuild.

<Tip>
Visual Studio Build Tools are acceptable if you do not want the full IDE. They provide the minimal necessary compilation environment.
</Tip>

## 2. Installing Visual Studio and Build Tools

There are two main ways to install the required Visual Studio components:

### Option A: Use Chocolatey (Recommended for Quick Setup)

If you have [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) installed, run this command in an elevated PowerShell or Command Prompt:

```powershell
choco install python visualstudio2022-workload-vctools -y
```

This installs the latest Python and Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools with the Visual C++ workload.

### Option B: Manual Installation

Follow these steps for manual installation and configuration:

1. **Install Python**

   Download and install Python from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/search?publisher=Python+Software+Foundation) or [official Python website](https://python.org). Ensure it’s on your system PATH.

2. **Install Visual Studio or Visual Studio Build Tools**

   - For Visual Studio Community 2019 or later, download from [Visual Studio website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
   - During installation, select the **'Desktop development with C++'** workload.
   - For Windows on ARM64, also add the following optional components:
     - "Visual C++ compilers and libraries for ARM64"
     - "Visual C++ ATL for ARM64"

3. **Verify that MSBuild is installed**

   MSBuild tools come with the Visual Studio installation under `MSBuild\Current\Bin`.

<Tip>
If using Visual Studio 2017 or older, use the Visual Studio Build Tools installer with the "Visual C++ build tools" option.
</Tip>

## 3. Confirming the Correct Components Are Installed

The following packages and tools must be present for native addon compilation:

- **MSBuild executable:** Typically found at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\<version>\<edition>\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe`.
- **C++ Toolset:** Versions `v141` (VS2017), `v142` (VS2019), or `v143` (VS2022).
- **Windows SDK:** Windows 10 SDK (at least version 10.0.17134.0) or Windows 11 SDK for VS2022.

### Verifying Installed Components

You can verify the installed Visual Studio components using PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-VSSetupInstance | Select-Object InstallationPath, InstallationVersion, Packages
```

Look specifically for the packages including:

- `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Tools.x86.x64` (C++ build tools)
- `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.Windows10SDK` versions
- `Microsoft.VisualStudio.VC.MSBuild.Base`

## 4. Configuring Your Environment

For smooth operation of `node-gyp`, ensure the following:

### 4.1 Install Powershell VSSetup Module (Optional but Recommended)

Install the `VSSetup` Powershell module to improve Visual Studio detection:

```powershell
Install-Module VSSetup -Scope CurrentUser
```

This allows node-gyp to use a reliable mechanism for detecting Visual Studio installations even if PowerShell is running in ConstrainedLanguage mode.

### 4.2 Environment Variables

`node-gyp` automatically detects your Visual Studio installation and Python executable. However, you can manually control the detection using these environment variables:

- `GYP_MSVS_VERSION` – Set this to specify Visual Studio version (for example, `2019` or `2022`).
- `GYP_MSVS_OVERRIDE_PATH` – Set this to the absolute path of your Visual Studio installation if detection needs to be manual.

## 5. How node-gyp Detects Visual Studio

When you run `node-gyp configure` or `node-gyp build` on Windows, the tool:

1. Attempts to detect Visual Studio installations using PowerShell and the VSSetup API.
2. Checks environment variables such as `VCINSTALLDIR` when running inside a Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt.
3. Validates required workloads and SDKs are present.
4. Chooses the most recent valid Visual Studio version matching your system and configuration.

If detection fails, `node-gyp` provides a detailed error message guiding you to install necessary components.

## 6. Running Your First Configuration and Build

Once Visual Studio is properly installed and configured, run the following commands in the root folder of your native addon:

```bash
# Generate Visual Studio project files
node-gyp configure

# Build the addon
node-gyp build
```

Expected results:

- A `.sln` (solution) file and project files are generated under the `build/` folder.
- Compilation starts using MSBuild.
- Compiled `.node` addon binaries are created in `build/Release/` or `build/Debug/`.

<Tip>
Use `--msvs_version=2019` or `--msvs_version=2022` with `node-gyp configure` if multiple Visual Studio versions are installed and you want to target a specific one.
</Tip>

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Visual Studio Setup on Windows">
<Accordion title="Visual Studio Not Found or MSBuild Missing">
If `node-gyp` cannot find Visual Studio or MSBuild, ensure:
- The "Desktop development with C++" workload is installed.
- MSBuild.exe is present under the Visual Studio MSBuild folder.
- Your PATH environment includes Visual Studio tools or you run within a Developer Command Prompt.
- You have installed the Powershell VSSetup module if running under constrained PowerShell.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Building on Windows ARM64">
To build for Windows on ARM64:
- Install Visual Studio 2022 version 17.4 or later.
- Include ARM64-specific C++ components and Windows 11 SDK.
- Ensure node-gyp detects the ARM64 MSBuild executable (usually under \arm64\MSBuild.exe).
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Multiple Visual Studio Versions Installed">
If multiple Visual Studio versions are installed, specify which to use:

```bash
node-gyp configure --msvs_version=2022
```

Or set the environment variable `GYP_MSVS_VERSION=2022` before running build commands.

This overrides automatic selection and resolves conflicts.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Python Detection Issues">
`node-gyp` requires Python 3.6 or newer.
If Python is not detected, ensure:
- Python is installed and on your PATH.
- You can manually specify Python with:

```bash
node-gyp --python C:\Path\To\python.exe configure
```

Refer to the [Python Setup](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#configuring-python-dependency) guide for details.
</Accordion>

## 8. Additional Tips and Best Practices

- Always keep your Visual Studio and Build Tools updated.
- Use the latest Windows SDK supported by your target environment.
- For CI environments, installing just Visual Studio Build Tools with the required workloads reduces build agent size.
- When troubleshooting, run commands with `--verbose` or `--loglevel=silly` to get detailed logs.
- Refer to Microsoft’s [Node.js Guidelines for Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejs-guidelines/blob/master/windows-environment.md#compiling-native-addon-modules) for further tips.
