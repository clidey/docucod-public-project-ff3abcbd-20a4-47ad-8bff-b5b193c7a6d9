# Essential Terminology

Master the core vocabulary critical to effectively using `node-gyp` and understanding its build workflow. This glossary defines foundational terms such as *native addon*, *binding.gyp*, *build directory*, header files, and essential commands like *configure*, *build*, and *rebuild*. It also introduces key external build tools involved in the process, including *GYP*, *Ninja*, *MSBuild*, and *Xcode*. Each term is explained simply, with references to where it fits into the typical addon development lifecycle or configuration files.

## Native Addon

A **native addon** is a dynamically loadable module written in C or C++ that extends Node.js with functionality implemented in native code. Native addons allow you to leverage system libraries or optimize performance-critical paths by compiling code that runs directly on the host architecture.

**Why It Matters:**
- Enables integration of fast, low-level code with JavaScript.
- Essential for performance-sensitive or platform-specific features.

**In Practice:** When building a native addon, you write `.cc` or `.cpp` source files that `node-gyp` compiles into a `.node` binary.

---

## binding.gyp

This JSON-like configuration file describes how to build your native addon. The file contains a structured dictionary specifying targets, source files, include paths, compiler flags, and platform-specific configurations.

Key Points:
- Located at the root of your addon project.
- Defines one or more `targets`, each with properties such as `target_name`, `sources`, and build settings.

**Example skeleton:**

```json
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "target_name": "myaddon",
      "sources": [ "src/myaddon.cc" ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Binding.gyp files are processed by `node-gyp` during the `configure` step to generate platform-specific build files.

[See detailed examples in the binding.gyp section](/overview/integration-and-ecosystem/addon-configs-and-examples)

---

## Build Directory

The **build directory** is the workspace folder (usually named `build/`) where intermediate and final build artifacts reside after you run `node-gyp` commands.

- Contains generated project files such as Makefiles (Unix), `.vcxproj` files (Windows), or Xcode projects (macOS).
- Holds the compiled native addon binaries, typically under subfolders like `Debug/` or `Release/`.

**User Tip:** Don’t manually modify files in the build directory; use `node-gyp clean` to clear this folder and start fresh if builds fail.

---

## Headers

**Header files** provide the API definitions and declarations your native addon depends on. These include:

- **Node.js headers:** Necessary for interacting with the Node.js core API.
- **V8 JavaScript engine headers:** Used when working with V8 internals.

`node-gyp` downloads and manages the correct versions of these header files for the target Node.js runtime.

**Typical Location:** Headers are installed under the build directory or user cache depending on configuration and platform.

**Practical Note:** Missing or incompatible header files are a frequent cause of build failures.

---

## Configure Command

`node-gyp configure` generates the project build files needed for your platform using the `binding.gyp` file.

**Key Outcomes:**
- Creates Makefiles on Linux and macOS, Visual Studio project files on Windows, or Xcode projects on macOS.
- Resolves target architecture, Python configuration, and platform-specific flags.

**User Workflow:** Run `configure` first to prepare your build system before compiling.

---

## Build Command

`node-gyp build` compiles the native addon sources into binary format using the build files produced in the configure step.

- Invokes platform-native build tools automatically: `make` on Unix, `msbuild` on Windows, or `xcodebuild` on macOS.
- Produces a `.node` file that can be `require()`d from Node.js.

**Success Indicator:** A compiled addon binary in `build/Release/` (or `build/Debug/` if debug mode is used).

---

## Rebuild Command

`node-gyp rebuild` is a convenient command that performs a `clean`, `configure`, and `build` sequentially.

Use this when your build environment or configuration changes and you need a full fresh compilation.

---

## GYP (Generate Your Projects)

**GYP** is the meta-build system embedded within `node-gyp`.

- It reads your `binding.gyp` file and generates native build files for the current platform.
- Supports multiple build targets like Visual Studio, Makefiles, Ninja, and Xcode.

**Why GYP?** It unifies the cross-platform build experience so you don’t write multiple project files manually.

For more, see [GYP User Documentation](https://gyp.gsrc.io/docs/UserDocumentation.md) and [Input Format Reference](https://gyp.gsrc.io/docs/InputFormatReference.md).

---

## Ninja

**Ninja** is a small, fast build system commonly used on Unix and Linux.

- If installed and configured, `node-gyp` may use Ninja to speed up build times as it is more efficient than traditional `make`.

- Ninja files are generated by GYP when selected.

**User Tip:** Installing Ninja can improve incremental build speeds, especially for larger projects.

---

## MSBuild

On Windows, **MSBuild** is the native build engine used for compiling Visual Studio project files.

- `node-gyp` uses MSBuild to drive the build process when generating `.vcxproj` files.
- Allows integration with Visual Studio and uses the Microsoft C++ compiler toolchain.

**Note:** Visual Studio or Build Tools must be installed and appropriately configured for MSBuild to work.

---

## Xcode

On macOS, **Xcode** is the native IDE and build system.

- When building on macOS, `node-gyp` generates Xcode projects with the `.xcodeproj` extension.
- Builds are then executed through Xcode’s `xcodebuild` command-line tool.

**Note:** Install Xcode or at least the Command Line Tools to ensure `node-gyp` builds successfully on macOS.

---

## How These Terms Fit Together in a Typical Workflow

1. **Prepare** your addon source files and write a `binding.gyp` file describing your build targets.
2. Run `node-gyp configure` to generate native project files using **GYP** based on your `binding.gyp`.
3. Run `node-gyp build` to compile sources via platform-native tools: **make**, **MSBuild**, **xcodebuild**, or **Ninja** if configured.
4. The compiled **native addon** binary appears in the **build directory** ready for Node.js.
5. Use `node-gyp rebuild` to clean and fully recompile when necessary.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Missing or incompatible Python, compiler toolchains, or headers are common blockers. Refer to setup guides for your OS.
- Ensure `binding.gyp` syntax is valid and paths are correct; invalid configs cause failures at `configure` time.
- If your environment has multiple Python or Python versions, explicitly specify Python path with `--python`.
- Use `node-gyp clean` before rebuilding if you encounter mysterious build artifacts.
- Check platform-specific build tools:
  - Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools and MSBuild availability
  - macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools installation
  - Linux: GCC/Make toolchain presence
